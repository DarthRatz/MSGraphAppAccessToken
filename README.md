# Microsoft Graph Application Permissions Access Token

This is a sample on how to use the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK with Application Permissions and your own Authentication Provider. For more information, see my blog post [here](https://www.lee-ford.co.uk/connect-graph-api-sdk-app-permissions/).

## Instructions

1. Create an Azure AD app with Graph Application Permissions. You will need the app ID, tenant ID and secret - for more info, see link to blog above

2. Clone this repository

3. Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies

4. Run ```tsc --build``` to compile to JavaScript in to _dist_ folder

5. Create an _.env_ file in the _dist_ folder and place the following inside (with your app details):

    **MicrosoftAppId**="_Azure AD App Id_"
    
    **MicrosoftAppPassword**="_Azure AD App Secret_"
    
    **MicrosoftAppTenantId**="_Azure AD Tenant Id_"
  
  6. Run ```npm start``` to run the script
